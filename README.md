# Developers: Getting Started
pylinkcloud is made for Python 3.4,
tested in 64-bit,
GUI is made with Qt 5.4.1 and uses PyQt5 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5).

If you haven't made GUIs with Qt before (PyQt5 specifically) check out my tutorial "How to Install PyQt5 and Build Your First GUI in Python 3.4": http://projects.skylogic.ca/blog/?p=110
